# Theme Development Overview

Layout of the necessary content was implemented via modifications through wordpress starter theme customization, additional CSS with the usage of plugins and code editor were applied when in-depth details were about to be made. Diverting blocks and content of the theme templates may result into a complete different architecture and structure- therefore reshaping must be done carefully and thoroughly. 

## Theme Origin

 The theme was created from twenty-twenty-two starter theme of wordpress, where it allows user to develop their own theme via theme editor matching their preferences.

## Theme Features

Theme follows several guidelines in building the theme template where whitespaces and layout were managed identically, padding and margin remains matching in every pages and posts. This was for appeal and to offer similar experience in every instance of visiting a section in the website. Header and Footer was built with HTML/CSS code for further customization preferred by the team and suitability with the contents from the client. 

## Design Decisions

Below are the specific design decisions made in creating and building the theme.

### Structure

Padding, margin, whitespaces are managable by code editor or template parts customization in theme editor in wordpress. 

### Typography

Google fonts plugin was used to apply 'Poppins', 'Sans-serif' to all pages.

### Colours

Minimal colors were used - #FFFFFF, #000000, #0000FF, and #0D98BA. Less colorful and bright hues were implemented for comfortable user experience and to suit the theme of the website itself.

## Further Developments

Further developments of the theme must be done in the theme editor specifically in wordpress, as well as the css codes for additional and detailed layouts. Pages and posts must be edited separately, as well as query loop patterns.
