# Theme Development Overview

Layout of the necessary content was implemented via modifications through wordpress starter theme customization, additional CSS with the usage of plugins and code editor were applied when in-depth details were about to be made. Diverting blocks and content of the theme templates may result into a complete different architecture and structure- therefore reshaping must be done carefully and thoroughly. 

## Theme Origin

 The theme was created from astra starter theme of wordpress, where it allows user to develop their own theme via theme editor matching their preferences.

## Theme Features

The theme keeps the white background, and the content still shows the correct margin and padding on different clients. And display the navigation bar and logo in the header.

## Design Decisions

Below are the specific design decisions made in creating and building the theme.

### Structure

Padding, margin, whitespaces are managable by code editor or template parts customization in theme editor in wordpress. 

### Colours

Minimal colors were used - #020101, #2FC1FF, #FFFFFF. Less colorful and bright hues were implemented for comfortable user experience and to suit the theme of the website itself.

## Further Developments

Further developments of the theme must be done in the theme editor specifically in wordpress, as well as the css codes for additional and detailed layouts. Pages and posts must be edited separately, as well as query loop patterns.
