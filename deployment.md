# Deployment Overview
The name of our web page is Baizonn Learning Center. <br>
We mainly use wordpress to write our website, and we use some tools to keep our work, keep changing our data.<br>
 Make sure he is up to date. We also use some tools for our group communication.

## Applications and Processes
We use discord for daily communication, sharing tutorials, ideas, and designs,<br>
 and we use Trello. Also we use desktop Github to upload our projects.

### Theme Development
We used the theme twenty-two in wordpress for development. <br>
This topic is a blank topic, so we can make some of our own definitions. <br>
First of all, our design for the background is white, and there are not many color assignments. <br>
The overall look will be relatively simple. For the header we use code, place the theme's logo, menu options,<br>
 and a search box. The footer is also written in code, placing some basic information and some social media

### Hosting and Deployment
At first we used X10hosting for hosting, but we gave up on X10 due to memory reasons.<br>
 Re-used AWS to host the website and developed an instance in EC2.<br>
  Use bitnami to write web pages using wordpress.
### Project Management
We have Trello to track and manage our projects.<br>
 We have three sections to record tracking items. The first part is the detailed task description and the second part is the task we are doing. <br>
 The third is the work that has been done. Trello can better help us document the overall flow of the project.
### Environment Overview
We used AWS to set up our environment, first we fired up a new instance. <br>
For Software Image we used Amazon Linux 2 and our virtual server is t2.micro type because it is free.
